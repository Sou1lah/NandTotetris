# Nand to Tetris: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles

[Course Website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Welcome to the **Nand to Tetris** project! This repository contains all the code, HDL designs, documentation, and tools for building a modern computer system from the ground up, following the legendary Nand2Tetris course.

## What is Nand to Tetris?

Nand to Tetris is a hands-on, project-based course that guides you through constructing a complete computer system, starting from the most basic logic gate (NAND) and culminating in a working computer capable of running programs written in a high-level language.

You will design and implement:
- Logic gates and combinational chips
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Memory hierarchy (registers, RAM, etc.)
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Assembler (translates assembly to machine code)
- Virtual machine and compiler (in later projects)
- Operating system and games (in later projects)

## Project Sequence

Each numbered folder corresponds to a major project step:

- **01 LogicGates/**: Basic gates (NAND, AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
- **02 ALU/**: Arithmetic Logic Unit
- **03 Memory/**: Registers, RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K, RAM16K, Program Counter
- **04 Assembler/**: Hack assembly language basics and assembler implementation
- **05 Computer/**: Integrating CPU, memory, and ROM into a full computer
- **06 Assembler/**: C implementation of the assembler
- *(Later projects: VM, compiler, OS, applications, etc.)*

Each folder contains:
- HDL files (hardware design language)
- C/Java/Python code (for assembler, etc.)
- Test scripts and sample programs
- Detailed README documentation
